Feature: Unsubscribe from CRVS vital events (POST /registry/unsubscribe)

This API is exposed by the CRVS and called by SP systems or other registries.
The CRVS acknowledges the request and delivers the result (UnSubscribeResponse)
to the on-unsubscribe callback.

  Background:
    Given the "unsubscribe" endpoint

  @smoke
  Scenario: An unsubscribe request is acknowledged
    Given an unsubscribe request for the subscription codes "SUB-0001"
    Then the request should be a valid "unsubscribe" message
    When the request is sent
    Then the HTTP status should be 200
    And the response should have a JSON content type
    And the response should be received within 15000 ms
    And the response should be a valid acknowledgement with ack_status "ACK"

  @functional
  Scenario: Several subscriptions can be cancelled at once
    Given an unsubscribe request for the subscription codes "SUB-0001, SUB-0002, SUB-0003"
    Then the request should be a valid "unsubscribe" message
    When the request is sent
    Then the response should be a valid acknowledgement with ack_status "ACK"

  @callback
  Scenario: The unsubscribe result is delivered to the on-unsubscribe callback
    Given an unsubscribe request for the subscription codes "SUB-0001, SUB-0002"
    And the callback listener is used as sender_uri
    When the request is sent
    Then the response should be a valid acknowledgement with ack_status "ACK"
    And an "on-unsubscribe" callback should be received
    And the callback should be a valid "on-unsubscribe" message
    And every subscription code should be reported as unsubscribed

  @negative
  Scenario Outline: An invalid unsubscribe request is rejected: <case>
    Given a valid request
    And the request field "<field>" becomes '<value>'
    When the request is sent
    Then the request should be rejected according to the DCI error model
