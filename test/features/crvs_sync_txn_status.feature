@method=POST @endpoint=crvs/sync/txn/status
Feature: Synchronous transaction status check (POST /registry/sync/txn/status)

This API is exposed by the CRVS and called by SP systems or other registries.
The response carries a callback header (action "txn-on-status") and a
TxnStatusResponse whose txn_status matches the requested txn_type.

  Background:
    Given the "sync txn status" endpoint

  @smoke
  Scenario: Successfully get the status of a search transaction
    Given a transaction status request for "search" transactions by "transaction_id"
    Then the request should be a valid "txn-status" message
    When the request is sent
    Then the HTTP status should be 200
    And the response should have a JSON content type
    And the response should be received within 15000 ms
    And the response should be a valid "sync-txn-status-response" message
    And the transaction status should be reported for a "search" transaction
    And every returned person record should be valid CRVS person data

  @functional
  Scenario Outline: Status of a <txn type> transaction looked up by <attribute type>
    Given a transaction status request for "<txn type>" transactions by "<attribute type>"
    Then the request should be a valid "txn-status" message
    When the request is sent
    Then the response should be a valid "sync-txn-status-response" message
    And the transaction status should be reported for a "<txn type>" transaction
    And every returned person record should be valid CRVS person data

    Examples:
      | txn type    | attribute type         |
      | search      | transaction_id         |
      | search      | reference_id_list      |
      | search      | correlation_id         |
      | subscribe   | transaction_id         |
      | subscribe   | subscription_code_list |
      | unsubscribe | subscription_code_list |
      | unsubscribe | correlation_id         |

  @negative
  Scenario Outline: An invalid sync transaction status request is rejected: <case>
    Given a valid request
    And the request field "<field>" becomes '<value>'
    When the request is sent
    Then the request should be rejected according to the DCI error model

    Examples:
      | case                               | field                                       | value               |
      | missing header                     | header                                      | <removed>           |
      | wrong action                       | header.action                               | "search"            |
      | missing message                    | message                                     | <removed>           |
      | missing transaction_id             | message.transaction_id                      | <removed>           |
      | unknown txn_type                   | message.txnstatus_request.txn_type          | "disburse"          |
      | unknown attribute_type             | message.txnstatus_request.attribute_type    | "uin"               |
      | missing attribute_value            | message.txnstatus_request.attribute_value   | <removed>           |
      | subscription_code_list given a string | message.txnstatus_request                | {"reference_id":"R1","txn_type":"subscribe","attribute_type":"subscription_code_list","attribute_value":"SUB-1"} |

  @negative
  Scenario: A body that is not JSON is rejected
    When the raw body "<xml/>" is sent
    Then the request should be rejected according to the DCI error model
