    Scenario: Successfully receive async search results from CRVS
        Given SP has previously sent a search request to CRVS
        When CRVS completes processing and calls SP on-search callback
        Then SP should receive the on-search response from CRVS
        And The on-search response should have status 200
        And The on-search response should have "Content-Type": "application/json" header
        And The on-search response should be received within 15000ms
        And The on-search response should match the expected JSON schema
