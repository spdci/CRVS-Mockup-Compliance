# CRVS Registry Compliance and Mockup

# Mockoon API
This is a mock application which performs API standards spec for a CRVS

# Prerequisites
You need to have Docker and Docker Compose up and running to be able to run this repo. Install Docker and Docker Compose [here](https://docs.docker.com/).
After installing Docker, you may need to follow the steps here in order to execute Docker and Docker Compose without sudo.

Setup
To run dockerized version of mocked API use shell script test_entrypoint.sh (requires docker and docker-compose). By default, API is available on port 3333.
Dockerfile was created using mockoon-cli.

# Changes in API definition
To introduce changes in API definition it is necessary to change content of mockoon-ibr.json file. It can be done using mockoon application.
Dockerized instance of application is not hot-reloaded, therefore it's necessary to restart server for changes to be applied.


# To Run the tests against ur specs 
Go to [helpers](https://github.com/spdci/CRVS-Mockup-Compliance/blob/master/test/features/support/helpers/helpers.js) and update the localhost url to point to your IBR URL. 
Go to test folder and use shell script test_entrypoint.sh to run the tests against your api once test is complete in [result folder](https://github.com/spdci/CRVS-Mockup-Compliance/tree/master/test/result)
you should be able to see the testing results.
